## Creative Objective

In this project, we aimed to demonstrate the considerable improvements that optional typing brings to JavaScript. By utilizing TypeScript, we were able to create new functions like our callApi function, allowing us to add generic typing to "know" the expected structure of our response and benefit from IntelliSense on the subproperties. Another objective was to showcase how TypeScript files can seamlessly work alongside JSX files, as exemplified by our JsonViewer component, which is implemented in JavaScript but is invoked from a TSX file.

## Tech Summary

Some of the tools used included: prettier (formats the files), fortawesome (icons), Typescript, Fake User Api, and React.

## Individual Member Contributions

### [Jadeyn]

Created the core components, such as the callApi function, Expander, buttons, and other various tools to enable the quick and easy creation of a website under the homepage, while maintaining its modularity and expandability. Also spent time organizing our file structure to place each file in a well-designated spot. Worked on adding some dependencies to introduce various functionalities and quality-of-life features, such as the importation of icons. View GitHub Contributions to see all contributions.

### [Sam]

One paragraph describing the contributions and work done by Sam, including specific tasks and achievements.

## Conclusion

The group learned how the addition of typing would be useful to enhance normal JavaScript and enable the use of IntelliSense. This was especially useful when it came to the callApi function, as adding generics to type the function allowed us to understand the expected data type of the response. Nothing went awry in this demo, as the functionality was intuitive. If I were to make changes to the project for the future, I would focus on improving page routing, as our current page routing for components like the JsonViewer isn't a genuinely effective method for real page navigation.
